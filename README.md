# SFL-NLPToolkit
A natural language processing toolkit based on systemic functional linguistic


## Descripion
Systemic functional linguistic (SFL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_functional_linguistics) is an relatively new applicable linguistic in past few decades. The application of systemic functional linguistic in natural language processing is gradually developing and the advantage This project is an attempt to apply part of the theory in SFL. With the SFL-based syntax tree parser, we could parse the syntax tree of much more complicated sentences (clause complexes, in SFL) and this parser could be easily updated by enriching vocabulary. Based on this syntax tree parser, we could easily understand the structures, not only the grammar but also the layer of meanings, therefore we could extract the key information in the clause complexes, i.e. what objects are involved (entity) and what processes are involved (event). Also there is a automatic grammatical metaphor built in the toolkit. Basically, the tool could packing information in the clauses and turn the words into a more academic style. The third part tool is a nominal density calculator which could measure the level of the grammatical metaphorization.
